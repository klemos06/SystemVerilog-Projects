**Overview**:


This hexadecimal addition calculator takes in two inputs controlled by flip switches on the DE10-Lite. The inputs are displayed on four seven segment displays, two for each input, and the result of the addition is display on two more seven segment displays. 

**Challenges**:
- Difficulty with containing the overflow of the addition and feeding the overflow onto the seven segment HEX display.
- Combining the two modules to take input from each register to feed the result seven segment.

**Accomplishments**:
- Developed combinational logic for seven segment HEX display from truth table.
- Integrated a manual clock function for asynchronous and sychronous processes for the first time!

**Goals**:
- Develop more algebraic operations onto the calculator (multiplication, subtraction, division).
- Create an automated clock system to control the operations.
